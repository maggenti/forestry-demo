Let's face it, today everyone needs to protect themselves. On websites there are a great many legal aspects that must be covered. Legislation has determined that there are specific categories of information that must be disclosed on any website.

  
 There are so many different hoops that sometimes it can take a long time to read all of them! However, we must jump through all of those hoops just like everyone else. The law also regulates the kinds of content that can be published on any website.  
 Thank you
