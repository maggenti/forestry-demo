The , the only place on the planet that will teach you how to design house plans for free! We will sell some items on our site in the future. 
Part of our current thinking is that we want to sell full house plans that our pupils have created.  These will contain the original 3D Models along with the CAD house plans. Yes, that's right, each and every set of CAD plans will come with the 3D model of that same house. 

Note: The fact is that each and every image on this site are actual renderings of 3D models.  They will be in sketchup (SKP) file format. Because Sketchup is a free program that allows you to not just view your 3D Model but modify it and it is easy to use. We shall see how things go.  

But we are very hopeful that our pupils will want to increase their income by selling their plans. We want this site to be the most comprehensive, easy-to-use source for House Design on the Web. But we need your help to do that. We want, no, need your input so that we have all the answers you will ever need. Our blog will have articles on everything from foundations to windows to roofs.  If you have questions at any time just ask. 

Our expert advice and guidance is available thanks to our more than 30+ years experience in the residential housing industry. 

We hope to become a favorite house-plan provider of professional builders everywhere, as well as individuals. 

Have fun, stay informed and have an enjoyable time on our website. Remember we are always here to help you.
