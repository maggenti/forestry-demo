textline: "Welcome to 3DePlans.com, the only place on the planet that will teach you
  how to design house plans for free! We will sell some items on our site in the future. 
  \n\nPart of our current thinking is that we want to sell full house plans that our
  pupils have created.  These will contain the original 3D Models along with the CAD
  house plans. Yes, that's right, each and every set of CAD plans will come with the
  3D model of that same house. \n\nNote: The fact is that each and every image on
  this site are actual renderings of 3D models.  They will be in sketchup (SKP) file
  format. Because Sketchup is a free program that allows you to not just view your
  3D Model but modify it and it is easy to use. We shall see how things go.  But we
  are very hopeful that our pupils will want to increase their income by selling their
  plans.\n\nWe want this site to be the most comprehensive, easy-to-use source for
  House Design on the Web. But we need your help to do that. \n\nWe want, no, need
  your input so that we have all the answers you will ever need. Our blog will have
  articles on everything from foundations to windows to roofs.  If you have questions
  at any time just ask. \n\nOur expert advice and guidance is available thanks to
  our more than 30+ years experience in the residential housing industry. \n\nWe hope
  to become a favorite house-plan provider of professional builders everywhere, as
  well as individuals. \n\nHave fun, stay informed and have an enjoyable time on our
  website. Remember we are always here to help you. \n\nShould you have any questions,
  use the links on our footer and be sure to sign up for our newsletter. \n\nWe Are
  Here To Help YOU!"
